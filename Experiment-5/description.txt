Dynamic Product Filter – Detailed Description

This project is a Dynamic Product Filter that lets users display only the products of a chosen category. It is divided into three parts:

1.exp5.html → Structure of the page

2.exp5.css → Styling and design

3.exp5.js → Filtering functionality

HTML (exp5.html)

The HTML file provides the structure for the project.

1.A container that holds everything

2.A heading "Product List"

3.A dropdown menu (select) with options: All, Clothing, Electronics, and Books

4.A product list (ul) where each item (li) has a category assigned through the data-category attribute

5.This makes it easy for JavaScript to recognize which category each product belongs to.

CSS (exp5.css)

1.The CSS file gives the page a simple, clean, and readable look.

2.The container has a border, padding, and fixed width

3.The dropdown is styled for usability with padding

4.Products are shown as separate boxes with borders, rounded corners, and light background

5.Proper spacing makes the list user-friendly

JavaScript (exp5.js)

The JavaScript file is the core logic of the project, responsible for filtering products dynamically.

Element Selection:

1.It first selects the dropdown menu so it can detect which category the user chooses.

2.It also selects all product items in the list so they can be shown or hidden as needed.

Filter Function:

1.A function is created to check the current value of the dropdown.

2.If "All" is selected, every product is displayed.

3.Otherwise, each product’s category is compared with the selected value.

4.Matching items are displayed, and non-matching items are hidden.

Event Listener:

1.An event listener is attached to the dropdown.

2.Whenever the user changes the category, the filter function runs immediately, updating the product list in real-time.

Initial Setup:

1.The filter function is also called once when the page first loads.

2.This ensures the list starts in a correct state even before the user interacts with it.

Key Points of JavaScript Functionality:

1.Uses category data stored in data-category attributes for accuracy

2.Updates the product list dynamically without reloading the page

3.Provides instant feedback to the user when they switch categories

4.Keeps the logic efficient by looping through all items only when needed

End Result: The user can select a category from the dropdown, and the product list updates immediately, showing only the relevant products.
